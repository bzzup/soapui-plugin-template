## soapui-plugin-template

A skeleton maven project containing sample listener, action and factory extensions for SoapUI.

Sample listeners and actions are in both Groovy and Java. The sample factory shows how to create a custom assertion, in
this case one that asserts a response to be valid JSON.

See the corresponding documentation on the SoapUI Website:
- [Extending SoapUI](http://www.soapui.org/Developers-Corner/extending-soapui.html)
- [Custom Factories](http://www.soapui.org/Developers-Corner/custom-factories.html)
